# Developer on the Earth

Hola! I'm Sainath, and I enjoy making coffee, designs, and software!

I'm a master's student and a self-proclaimed internet nerd. In my free time, I love reading books, singing songs, and overthinking everything.

Here, I share my thoughts and learnings about topics that interest me. My brain is constantly buzzing with ideas about web development, cloud computing, and blockchain.
